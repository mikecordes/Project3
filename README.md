## Background

  

The National Park Service (NPS) is part the United States Department of the Interior and holds the role of preserving the national parks system.  This includes over 84 million acres across all fifty states.  

## **THE IMPORTANCE OF NATIONAL PARKS**

The main reason for creating our park system was for the conservation and protection of the environment and its wildlife. Some people have called our National Parks “[America’s Best Idea](https://www.amazon.com/Ken-Burns-National-Parks-Americas/dp/B01CJCQGOU).” Below, you’ll find the reasons are parks are critical to current and future generations of Americans.

### ​1. PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY

Earth is our home, and it’s also humankind’s most precious resource. So as caretakers of the planet, we need to protect Earth’s biodiversity. It took billions of years for evolution to create a wide diversity of life on the planet.

However, because of our own making, this biodiversity is continuously under threat.

The protection of this diversity of wildlife is one of the reasons why are parks important. Our National Parks protect these many species by providing a sanctuary for the plants and animals whose habitats are too often destroyed by humans.

High levels of biodiversity mean healthier and more resilient ecosystems. This results in the natural  [ecosystem’s](https://sciencing.com/ecosystem-work-5333030.html) ability to continue providing benefits like climate regulation, pollination, air purification, and more.

The federal government ensures that they can protect our parks from potential abusers. According to the Protection Of Government Property law, violators of these regulations are penalized, with punishment ranging from a $500 fine to three months of imprisonment. Sometimes both.

### ​2. LEISURE AND PERSONAL WELL-BEING

Connecting with Mother Nature is always a life-changing experience. Those who have been experienced the great outdoors come to a realization of just how beautiful our planet is. Most even gain a new perspective on life.

Our parks system provides an opportunity for Americans to experience the vast expanses of the outdoors. Nothing beats a good ol’ camping when it comes to providing a healthy and inexpensive leisure time. Our National Parks showcase the best that nature can offer. Undoubtedly, going to a National Park is one of the few ways to experience nature in its purest form.

From the whales off the coast of the Olympic National Park to the American Bison of the Yellowstone, visitors have an opportunity to see and interact with different forms of wildlife.

On top of that, many National Parks offer different activities like  [hiking](https://gotonationalparks.com/dec-2018-best-camera-backpack-for-hiking-and-travel/), cycling, camping, kayaking, and more. And as long as park visitors follow the rules and guidelines, they’ll remain safe.

National parks give a one of a kind chance to Americans and guests alike to encounter tremendous scopes of nature. They likewise give access to a striking number of exercises, none of which happen to require versatile Internet.

American parks should be ensured in light of the fact that they stay one of only a handful couple of spots that Americans have left to really encounter nature in a pleasant and various way. They exhibit the best of nature before industrialization twisted our normal scene.

National parks are an incredible way not exclusively to disappear to the serenity of nature, yet to see nature in its actual component. Contingent upon the recreation center, guests can see hundreds, even a huge number of various kinds of untamed life. From the bears of Yellowstone to the local salmon of Olympic National Park, guests of any age can connect with or avoid creatures from varying backgrounds.

The thing about nature is that it gives various relaxation exercises individually. Outside of pausing for a minute to take in the fresh air, guests can likewise partake in some human-based exercises. A portion of the land exercises that guests can participate in incorporate cross-country skiing, climbing, snowshoeing, and open-air diversions. They can even participate in cycling and mountain biking relying upon the recreation center.

Parks that offer access to clean water permit individuals the opportunity to swim, kayak and kayak in a sheltered domain. It is an opportunity for individuals to feel what it resembles to float through water that isn’t chlorinated or vigorously dirtied.

In any case, the National Park Service has likewise been quick to make open doors for relaxation exercises for guests. For instance, Shenandoah National Park made a Kids In Parks trail intended for little kids to have the option to investigate the recreation center by walking.

The national stops likewise offer outdoors openings that enable individuals to encounter nature in an undeniable manner. Huge numbers of the exercises recorded are offered only by the national parks. Ensuring the parks would mean securing significant exercises that give tremendous amusing to Americans and guests.

For a long time, America’s national parks have attempted to give puts that don’t just safeguard history yet in addition advance lives. This improvement isn’t just social, it tends to be physical and otherworldly also. The parks’ capacity to give advancement in individuals’ lives isn’t exclusively founded on the space it offers. The general population behind the parks have attempted to guarantee that the parks add to American wellbeing too. In 2011, the National Park Service propelled its Healthy Parks Healthy People US anticipate.

The objective of this program was to change the recreation center from essentially being a recreational or social space and rather center around being a space that purposefully engaged a national wellbeing procedure. It does not simply offer open doors at national parks. The program gives assets to state and neighborhood parks. Together with researchers, social insurance pioneers, promotion associations and business trendsetters, the National Park Service attempts to utilize its assets to change the manner in which Americans settle on decisions about their way of life.

Through its administration, the parks permit individuals to access to solid encounters and manufacture significant associations in the network all for the sake of more prominent wellbeing. The national park framework couldn’t be at the focal point of this program without the assistance of the government. In this way, it must be ensured.

### ​3. ECONOMIC BENEFITS

In 2017, our National Parks received 331 million visitors. This number just fell short of 90,000 visits, to beat 2016’s record-breaking visits. Most significantly, visitors spend an estimated $18 billion that year, which supported thousands of jobs and added billions to the economic output of the country.

And the economic benefits of National Parks extend beyond the scope of tourism. The natural amenities and recreational opportunities offered by National Parks support businesses and help them retain employees.

While you certainly can’t put any dollar value on these pristine forests and towering peaks, there’s no doubt that the country’s National Parks have a significant economic impact.

### ​4. CENTERS FOR LEARNING

Our National Parks also happen to be America’s largest classrooms.

The park system provides a beneficial contribution to the country’s education system. On top of teaching students about the importance of the environment and why it’s critical to protect nature, the parks also provide actual field experiences and professional development opportunities for students.

There are even centers like the Museum of the National Park Ranger in Yellowstone, where visitors can learn about the history and heritage of National Park rangers in the system.

There are also park services that offer long-distance learning opportunities that allow students to learn about the world around them without the need to leave the classroom. Specifically, using virtual reality programs, students can tour with a park ranger or go whale watching.

### **5. THEY BENEFIT THE ENVIRONMENT OVERALL**

When it comes to the importance of national parks, their overall environmental benefits cannot be overlooked. As we previously mentioned, they bring a great amount of joy to people all over the world who come to take part in experiencing the beauty of uncorrupted nature and incredible biodiversity. What makes their service so significant?

National parks enjoy a protected legal status to protect rare and endangered flora and fauna. In a national park, we get to enjoy and discover nature in its uncorrupted state. Think about the soil, plants, air, water, and indigenous life forms. Developing national parks as centers for environmental learning helps us to imitate nature, its rhythms, and preserve life. Besides keeping national parks as a tourist attraction, there are two primary reasons why we should protect national parks around the world.

First, they serve as energy sources. In numerous cases, national parks protect natural resources used for energy generation. The most obvious example here is water. For instance, as indicated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the private hold Eternal Forest of Children in Costa Rica gives water to an organization that creates power and is paid for it in kind.

Second, they preserve natural resources and prevent depletion. Protected regions can help alleviate the effects of cataclysmic events with soil adjustment (for instance, maintaining a strategic distance from torrential slides, avalanches, and disintegration) and diminishing floods (for instance, moderation in little bowls, insurance of alluvial fields and wetlands). They can likewise help in ensuring coasts by utilizing mangroves, sand ridges or coral reefs as tempest hindrances.
